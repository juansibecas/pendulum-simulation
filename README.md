# pendulum-simulation
Design and simulation of a reaction wheel inverted pendulum stabilization and swingup switching controller. Nonlinear plant simulations made in Simulink. 
Future implementation will be done on a ARM microcontroller based on this design.

## TODO upgrade switching logic based on phase space analysis
